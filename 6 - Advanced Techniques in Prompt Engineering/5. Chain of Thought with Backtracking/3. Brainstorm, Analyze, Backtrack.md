Lastly, let's combine Chain of Thought, Backtracking, AND a method we've learned about earlier in this course - Brainstorming, to solve this same problem. Add a Brainstorming step before Forward Analysis, guiding the LLM to think about potential approaches without giving a solution.

As you know by now, the correct answer to this question is 6210001000, but it's totally fine if you don't get the exact answer; the key to this practice is a proper application of the Brainstorming method to the given starter code.

__ASK__

Find a 10-digit number where the first digit is how many zeros in the number, the second digit is how many 1s in the number etc. until the tenth digit which is how many 9s in the number.

__REQUIREMENTS__
- Brainstorming
  -  take ur time and do Brainstorming
- Forward Analysis
  - Think step-by-step to analyze the problem - do not suggest an answer.
- Backtracking
  - After the initial step-by-step analysis, work backward from the end to come up with the answer.
